This project is a **work in progress**. The app will allow you to consult the I Ching from your terminal. I've written it to serve as a gentle introduction to the full-tilt OOP capabilities of TypeScript which I am currently studying. The reading is generated through simple arithmetic. Its numerical value within the I Ching will then be used as an endpoint to query the text of the I Ching via a REST API. A wrapper for TS/JS doesn't yet exist anywhere so I'm gonna write that too based on a PHP version.
